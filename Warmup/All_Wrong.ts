// Problem: All Wrong
// There's a multiple-choice test with N questions, numbered from 1 to N. Each
// question has 2 answer options, labelled A and B. You know that the correct
// answer for the ith question is the ith character in the string C, which is
// either "A" or "B", but you want to get a score of 0 on this test by answering
// every question incorrectly.

// Your task is to implement the function getWrongAnswers(N, C) which returns a
// string with N characters, the ith of which is the answer you should give for
// question i in order to get it wrong (either "A" or "B").

// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 100
// C{i} âˆˆ {'A', 'B'}

// Solution
// Time Complexity: O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(N)
// Explanation: None

export const getWrongAnswers = (N: number, C: string): string => {
  const wrongAnswers: string[] = [];

  for (const ans of C) {
    if (ans === "A") {
      wrongAnswers.push("B");
    } else {
      wrongAnswers.push("A");
    }
  }

  return wrongAnswers.join("");
};
