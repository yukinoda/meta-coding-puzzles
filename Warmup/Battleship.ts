// Problem: Battleship
// You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with R rows and C columns. There
// are 0 or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell.
// The cell in the ith row from the top and jth column from the left either
// contains a battleship (G{i,j} = 1) or doesn't (G{i,j} = 0).

// You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid. You'll
// choose this cell uniformly at random from the R * C possible cells. You're
// interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a
// battleship.

// Your task is to implement the function getHitProbability(R, C, G) which
// returns this probability.

// Note: Your return value must have an absolute or relative error of at most
// 10^(-6) to be considered correct.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= R, C <= 100
// G{i,j} âˆˆ {0, 1}

// Solution
// Time Complexity: O(R * C)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Explanation: Count the number of ships and divide by the total number of
// cells. Because the cells are either 0 or 1, the number of ships is the same
// as the sum of all the cells.

export const getHitProbability = (
  R: number,
  C: number,
  G: number[][]
): number => {
  let numShips = 0;
  for (const row of G) {
    numShips += row.reduce((acc, curr) => {
      return acc + curr;
    }, 0);
  }
  return numShips / (R * C);
};
